# LocomotiveCMS Engine in a Docker container

This is a Docker configuration for running [LocomotiveCMS Engine](https://github.com/locomotivecms/engine) in a Docker container. Two containers, actually: one for the [MongoDB image](https://hub.docker.com/r/_/mongo/), and another for Locomotive Engine.
